      "page_content='AI Site Generator\\nWhy we built it\\nAlthough half of new users begin by using a template, most of them get discouraged by the large gap between the template and their desired site.\\nUsing generative AI allows us to customize templates in a way that saves users loads of time and reduces hurdles to adopting Webflow. AI Site Generator can customize:\\nPlaceholder text\\nImage assets\\nSite structure\\nPage structure\\nTheme (fonts & colors)\\nWith the result that in ~20 seconds\\nHow it works\\nStep 1: Generate a theme. We ask the LLM to generate several themes (colors + fonts) based on the user’s site description. The user then picks one of the suggested themes.\\nStep 2: Create variables using these theme. Server-side, we create a new site and add variables that correspond to the theme elements.\\nStep 3: Create a sitemap. We ask the LLM to generate a complete sitemap based on the user’s site description. This sitemap includes all pages as well as each section included on those pages.\\nStep 4: Hydrate sitemap. Using the sitemap as a guide, we create a full Webflow site (server-side!). Specifically, we:\\nUse library sections (these are currently third-party libraries, but we could also use in-house libraries)\\nReplace copy (no more placeholder text!)\\nGenerate images (using DALL-E 3)\\nBind styles to variables (since libraries don’t support variables yet)\\nFurther reading\\nHow to use the AI Site Generator\\nService layer\\nA snapshot of the Site Generator , taken Nov 28, 2023  \\nt l ; d r : In roughly 20 seconds, AI Site Generator creates full websites from a short, plain-English description. These sites have customized sitemaps, page structures, placeholder text, images, \\nand themes—so they really feel like they were built specifically for the user.' metadata={'source': './site-generator.pdf', 'page': 0}\n"
